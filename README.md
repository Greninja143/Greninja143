[Brief Introduction - Remove this afterwards]

I am a BCA graduate with a profound interest in technology and a strong dedication to solving complex problems. Since completing my degree last year, I have developed a focused passion for digital forensics and aim to contribute my skills to support criminal investigations within a law enforcement digital forensics team.

## Objective
My journey in computer science has led me to develop a strong passion for digital forensics. I am now eager to apply my technical skills and forensic knowledge in a law enforcement setting, with the goal of joining the Digital Forensics team within the police department to support criminal investigations through evidence analysis.
